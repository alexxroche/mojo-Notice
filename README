mojo-Notice

mojo-Notice - A MVC (DBIC,TT,CAS) Mojolicious Customer Resource and Account Manager inspired by Notice

In the controller I prefer sub main { } to sub index { }
Due to language support a Runmode/Controller MUST be three characters or longer and not be in the form
/\w\w([_-]?\w\w)?/ e.g. en_GB or pt-br 
but this seems like a limitation that we can live with

INSTALLATION

  In stall the database, set up the configuration, run script/create_dbic_schema.pl and then:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	sudo make install
